# - The last description tag
# - The current revision hash (shortened)
# - The number of commits between the last tag and HEAD
# - Is the repository checkout dirty?
#
# Then put all this information into the gitstamp file, but only if
# if the current contents of the file does not different from what
# we have just read from the repository. This guarantees that the
# version file is only recompiled if the repository information
# changed.

# This hack is based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/10727593/4416194
# by exploiting
# https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Remaking-Makefiles .
#
# NOTE: GNU Make 4.4 breaks the trick somewhat: we can't declare
# the gitstamp rule .PHONY anymore, because then GNU Make 4.4 will
# not call anymore. Without making it .PHOHY, it works again.
# What this, in effect, changes is that now, an aptly named file
# would be included here and might influence the build process...

# build flags, automake will rename the object files to include the
