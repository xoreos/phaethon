   Phaethon uses Benoit Sigoure's boost.m4 autoconf macros
   (<https://github.com/tsuna/boost.m4>) to check for the needed Boost
   libraries. boost.m4 is licensed under version 3 or later of the GNU General
   Public License. For the full license text, see COPYING or

UTF-8 CPP
*********
   Phaethon uses the lightweight header-only UTF-8 CPP library
   (<https://github.com/nemtrif/utfcpp>) for handling UTF-8 encoded strings.
   UTF-8 CPP is licensed under the Boost Software License. See
   external/utf8cpp/LICENSE or <https://www.boost.org/users/license.html>
   for details.

mingw-std-threads
*****************
   Phaethon uses and includes the header-only mingw-std-threads library
   (<https://github.com/meganz/mingw-std-threads/>) as an alternative to
   libwinpthread for C++11 std::thread in MinGW builds. mingw-std-threads
   is licensed under the terms of the 2-clause BSD license. For the full
   text, see external/mingw-std-threads/LICENSE or
   <https://github.com/meganz/mingw-std-threads/blob/master/LICENSE>.

Verdigris
*********
   Phaethon uses and includes the header-only library Verdigris
   (<https://github.com/woboq/verdigris>) to use Qt5 without moc. Verdigris
   is licensed under version 3 or later of the Lesser GNU General Public
   License. For the full license texts, see external/verdigris/LICENSE.LGPLv3
   or <https://gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>.

ScummVM code
************
   Phaethon uses some ScummVM (<https://scummvm.org/>) code, most prominently
   the endian, singleton and stream code. ScummVM is licensed under version 2
   or later of the GNU General Public License. For the full license text, see
   doc/LICENSE.GPLv2 or <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html>.

WMA
***
   The WMA decoder used in Phaethon is based (heavily) on the WMA decoder in
   FFmpeg (<https://ffmpeg.org/>), licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
   License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later. For the full license text, see
   doc/COPYING.LGPLv2.1 or <https://gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>.

Google Test
***********
   Phaethon uses Google Test (<https://github.com/google/googletest>), Google's
   C++ test framework. Google Test is licensed under the terms of the 3-clause
   BSD license. For the full license text, see tests/googletest/LICENSE or
   <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/LICENSE>.

libmspack
*********
   xoreos uses libmspack, a library for Microsoft compression formats
   (<https://www.cabextract.org.uk/libmspack/>). This is needed to handle
   Xbox LZX decoding. Since the library does not offer a direct API to
   the LZX decoding, xoreos completely includes the library code. libmspack
   is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1.
   For the full license text, see external/mspack/COPYING.LIB or
   <https://gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>.

UEViewer
********
   xoreos includes code based on UEViewer (<https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel>)
   to handle the Xbox LZX decompression. UEViewer is licensed under the terms of the
   MIT license. For the full license text, see <<https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>.
